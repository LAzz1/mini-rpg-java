# Mini Java RPG

I made this project for my college test, with Java I needed to made a program that you can choose between 3 or more characters, after you need to choose again
between this same three characters to fight against. In this project was necessary give two options in battle for the user, fight or healing, and needed to print
the round, life, strength and the name (3 class of fighters). When the characters life bet zero the game over, if the user life bet zero the user lost the game, if
the character you choose to fight against dies first the user win the game.
